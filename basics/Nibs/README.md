# Working with Nibs

## Loading Nib into View Controller

Simplest thing you can do is create a nib and then associated it with a View Controller.

- Create the nib (same name as view controller).
- Set it's File's Owner to the `ViewController`.
- Point the File's Owner `view` to the nib view

## Loading a Nib into a Nib

Two ways you can go about this:

1. Load the nib manually.
2. Make it `IBDesignable`.

## Nib loading manually

When you want to compose nibs into other nibs, you need to load them manually.

Create a new nib.

Create it's associated view (with the same name).

Associated the view with the nib.

Reference the nib from the parent nib view loading it via the `Bundle` and layout out with Auto Layout.

## How to make a nib IBDesignable

To make a control `@IBDesignable` you need to add a plain view first, then associated it with the nib you want to display (marked up as @IBDesignable).

### Make `IBDesignable` & `IBInspectable`

Make nib you want to display `@IBDesignable` and `IBInspectable`

Drag out a new view into the nib.

Associated the new view with the designable class. Xcode will update.

And you will now see attribute in inspector pane.

## Apple Documentation notes

Xibs

- designed for working with Views
- is an object graph 
- containing views and relationships

File's Owner

- this is a placeholder that you set when you load your nib
- it is the controller for the nib and it receives all the events
- typically you use outlets in the File's Owner to reference objects in the nib

References

- outlets to top level objects can be strong
- while outlets to subviews weak

Each View Controllers Manages its Own Nib File

- UIViewController support the automatically loading of their own associated nib file

Loading Nib Files Programmatically

- NSBundle supports loading of nib files
- loadNibNamed:owner:options: instance method

> Important: You are responsible for releasing the top-level objects of any nib files you load when you are finished with those objects. Failure to do so is a cause of memory leaks in many applications. After releasing the top-level objects, it is a good idea to clear any outlets pointing to objects in the nib file by setting them to nil. You should clear outlets associated with all of the nib fileâ€™s objects, not just the top-level objects.
