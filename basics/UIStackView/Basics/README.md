# UIStackView Basics

Let's say we want to build this model using a `UIStackView`.

We can start off with a `UILabel` and `UITextField` side-by-side.

But what we are missing is the hugging and compression necessary to tell autolayout which control to expand, and which not to.

Usually in this situation we want the label to hold it's intrinsic width, and have the text field expand. So we **increase** the `UILabel` horizontal and vertical **hugging**, while **decreasing** the `UITextField` hugging and horizontal resistance.

OK not bad. But what we need are some attributes on our stack views.
