`UITextField` gives you a give board for free. Two dismiss the keyboard when the user is done with it, call `resignFirstResponder` directly on the `UITextField` as shown below in func `buttonPressed`.

import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet var textField: UITextField!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // dismiss keyboard via tap gesture
        let tapGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(viewTapped))
        view.addGestureRecognizer(tapGesture)
    }

    @objc func viewTapped() {
        view.endEditing(true)
    }
    
    // or by giving up first responder
    @IBAction func buttonPressed(_ sender: UIButton) {
        textField.resignFirstResponder()
    }
    
    // Note: `view.endEditing(true)` scans entire view until if finds first responder to resign
    //       `textField.resignFirstResponder()` is a more direct call to the textfield itself
}
```

## endEditting vs resignFirstResponder

Another way to dismiss the keyboard is to call `endEditting` on a `UIView` containing a `UITextField`. Which is better?

resignFirstResponder() is good when you know which text field has the keyboard. It’s direct. It’s efficient. Use it when you have the `UITextField` causing the keyboard to appear and you want to give it up.

`endEditing` is actually a method on the `UIView`. Use this when you don’t know who caused the keyboard to appear or you don’t have reference to the `UITextField` currenty in focus. It searches all the subviews in the view hierarchy until it finds the one holding the first responder status and then asks it to give it up. Not as efficient. But it works too (just more broadly).
