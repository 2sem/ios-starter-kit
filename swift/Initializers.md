# Initializers

Initialization is the process of preparing an instance of a class, structure, or enumeration for use. This process involves setting an initial value for each stored property on that instance and performing any other setup or initialization that is required before the new instance is ready for use.

## Private Lazy Vars

These are nice because they defer instantiation until the variable is called for the first time, after which their value is saved. So, if you call the variable for the second time, the previously saved value is returned.

```swift
    private lazy var handleView: UIView = {
        let view = UIView()
        view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        view.backgroundColor = UIColor(white: 1, alpha: 0.5)
        view.layer.cornerRadius = 3
        return view
    }()
```

## Setting Initial Values for Stored Properties

Classes and structures must set all of their stored properties to an appropriate initial value by the time an instance of that class or structure is created. Stored properties cannot be left in an indeterminate state.

```swift
struct Fahrenheit {
    var temperature: Double
    init() {
        temperature = 32.0
    }
}
```

## Assigning Constant Properities During Intialization

You can assign a value to a constant property at any point during initialization, as long as it is set to a definite value by the time initialization finishes. Once a constant property is assigned a value, it canâ€™t be further modified.

```swift
class SurveyQuestion {
    let text: String
    var response: String?
    init(text: String) {
        self.text = text
    }
}
```

## Default Initializers

Swift provides a default initializer for any structure or class that provides default values for all of its properties and does not provide at least one initializer itself. The default initializer simply creates a new instance with all of its properties set to their default values.

```swift
lass ShoppingListItem {
    var name: String?
    var quantity = 1
    var purchased = false
}
var item = ShoppingListItem()
```
