# Single Touch Simulator

When you are giving demos or you need to record an animated gif, it can help if you set this flag on your iOS simulator to show a large circle everytime your touch.

Open a terminal and type:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.iphonesimulator ShowSingleTouches -bool YES
```
